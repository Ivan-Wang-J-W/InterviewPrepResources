### Data Structures

In this directory, you will find implementations of various data structures, including arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, and more along with the various source code for each topic. I will be mainly using `c++`.

As I am following the [The TechInterviewHandbook](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/coding-interview-study-plan/)'s comprehensive study plan I will also be incorporating the use of the [Grind75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75) website. This website is useful as it generates recommended study plans for coding interviews based on the time you have left. More options like filtering by difficulty, topics, and alternative grouping of questions can be found there. As the study plan also uses questions from Grind75, Some questions encountered here might have been previously attempted when studying the various Data Structures. I will highlight it in the Data Structures folder. 

ps, this follows the 3 month study-plan. The Grind75 tool will generate a study plan that is customized to you. Questions that were not included originally will be ear marked as additional practise.
