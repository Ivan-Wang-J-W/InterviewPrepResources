# INTERVIEW PREP RESOURCES

## About This Repository

This repository serves as a record of my Data Structures and Algorithm learning journey along with other resources I find useful in aiding me in preparing for my Internship and eventual Full-time job hunt. I hope this small collection of resources will aid other prospective Software Engineers in due time. 

## Repository Structure

Currently, as of 2024-03-01 it contains 2 directories, Grind75 and Interviews. I will occasionally update this repository and amend it accordingly.
