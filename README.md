# INTERVIEW PREP RESOURCES

## About This Repository

This repository serves as a record of my Data Structures and Algorithm learning journey along with other resources I find useful in aiding me in preparing for my Internship and eventual Full-time job hunt. I hope this small collection of resources will aid other prospective Software Engineers in due time. 

## Repository Structure

Currently, as of 2024-03-01 it contains 2 directories, Grind75 and Mock Interviews. I will occasionally update this repository and amend it accordingly.

## Grind 75
 Under this folder, there are 2 subdirectories. 
- [Data Structures](#Data-Structures)
- [Lc](#Lc)

### Data Structures

In this directory, you will find implementations of various data structures, including arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, and more along with the various source code for each topic. I will be mainly using `c++`.

### Lc

As I am following the [The TechInterviewHandbook](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/coding-interview-study-plan/)'s comprehensive study plan I will also be incorporating the use of the [Grind75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75) website. This website is useful as it generates recommended study plans for coding interviews based on the time you have left. More options like filtering by difficulty, topics, and alternative grouping of questions can be found there. As the study plan also uses questions from Grind75, Some questions encountered here might have been previously attempted when studying the various Data Structures. I will highlight it in the Data Structures folder.
